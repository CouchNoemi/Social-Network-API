# Social-Network-API

## Description
My motivation to do this project is learning more about NoSQL/MongoDB, experiment with different methods and improve my skills. I built this project to create a API that can be used for interacting with users I can create list of friends, delete, update and create users and also post, update and delete thoughts in my social network. I challenged my imagination and compared the different uses of my code.It has a good interaction with the user. I am using insomnia to test it.
I will be using MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
I  built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
